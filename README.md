# COMPLETE WALKTHROUGH

# 1. Regular User Functionalities

# Home Page
The home page consists of three big components, one is the general home page that introduces our website, another one is the user log in page and the third one is the user sign up page. 

### General Home Page
This page is used to provide users a general feeling of what our website does. On the top header, it shows the name of the website, Login button and Get started button. Below that is an image slider that shows some website related photos that visually introduce user what our website does. However, right now, these images are obtained online, it is not the actual images of our website, this is because we would put those photos on after our website is fully functioning and the website frontend can be further improved. At the bottom is the footer for the website which has the obtain of Contact Us and About Us as well as copyright information.

> **Note:** Please see the "Contact Us" and "About Us" section for a more general explanation.

### Sign Up Page
Any button with the name "Get Started" will lead you to the sign up page, where this sign up page is used in the future for actual users to sign up. There are two level of users, one is regular user and one is financial user. The sign up form changes according to the user level. For financial advisors, they would need an "Admin passcode" in order to successfully sign up. The rest are the general required basic information about the user. If there is a * in the textfield, this indicates those information are required. For the password, it has to be at least 8 characters otherwise it will show the error message. For confirming the password, it will also show error message if the passwords do not match. After these are done, the user can click "SIGN UP" to sign up, these information will be stored in a database in the future. Then this page will direct you to the Log in page. One can also click on the "Back to Home" button on the top right corner to return back to the home page. 

### Log In Page
The "Log in" button on the home page will lead you to the log in page where the user can input their username and password. Currently, there are two options of credentials: 1. username and password are both "user" (for regular users), 2. username and password are both "admin" (for financial advisors). If the credentials are wrong, the user will not be able to log in to the website and will be redirected back to the login page. If the credentials are correct, the user will be redirected to the Spendings page (for regular users) or the Community page (for financial advisors). In the future, these credentials will be verified in the backend. 

# Spendings

### Pie Chart 
The Spendings page now has a toggle button for “Details” and “Overview” mode. The "Details" mode will show the pie chart. The pie chart provides a visual representation to the user's spendings. It will show how much the user has spent in each category in comparison to other categories. If you hover over the sections, it'll also display the total amount of dollars the user spent in that category.

> **Note:** Please see the "Pie Chart" section for a more general explanation. 

### Bar Chart (Phase 2 Functionality)
The Spendings page now has a toggle button for “Details” and “Overview” mode. The “Details” mode will contain the regular information (table and pie chart) as before. The “Overview” mode will now provide a spendings overview of the regular user’s actual and projected spendings throughout the year. As the regular user adds new transactions or months, the bar chart will be automatically updated.

### Transaction History 
The table provides an overview of each individual transaction for the user's spendings. Each entry will contain a "Date", "Amount", "Description" and "Category". 
 
 -- Date: click on the calendar icon to select a date for the transaction, you can also manually type in the date through the input field. If the input is invalid, it will indicate that the date entry is invalid. 
 -- Amount: enter the amount of the spending in the input field, if you try to input anything that is not a number, it will also indicate that the entry is invalid. 
 -- Description: enter the description of the transaction, this can be of any type.
 -- Category: select a category this transaction falls under
 
 For the table in "Spendings", the user can also add a customized category to their transaction history. By clicking on the more icon (three vertical dots), a menu will be brought up. The user can then enter their new category in the "New Category" input and press the add icon to add. If they want to remove a customized category, simply click the category they want to remove. 

> **Note 1:** The default categories (food, personal, transit, home) cannot be deleted. 

> **Note 2:** Please see the "Table" section for a more general explanation. 

### Spendings By Month (Deletion -> Phase 2 Functionality)
Each month/year is a seperate spendings page. The user can use the sidebar on the left to navigate to their spending history in a specific month/year. To add a new spending page, click the add icon on the top of the side bar and enter all the following information:
-- Month: the month that you want to enter your transactions for 
-- Year: the year you want to enter your transactions for 
-- Projected Spendings: the goal amount you want for your spendings that month

To delete a sheet from the month, the user can simply right click on the month and click on the delete button. 

# Investments

### Bar Chart (Phase 2 Functionality)

Each row represents a stock this person purchased, including the number of shares, book cost (which is how much they paid), price (which is the current price), bookCosts (the total amount spent on this stock), gain/loss based on the purchasing price and current price, market value based on the total number of shares' value ...etc.

### Live Stock Data (Phase 2 Functionality)
On every buy and sell, the server will get actual stock quotes from Yahoo finance, using the closing price of the day inputted by the user/or the current day
1. Buy:
    - The user will be able to input the date of purchase, name of stock(ticker), quantity(number of stocks)
    - The book cost, gain loss...etc. will be calculated in the server and updated accordingly
2. Sell:
    - The server will use today’s date as the sell date, and update the quantity, book cost...etc. accordingly
    - If the user sells all of his/her shares of a particular stock, the entry will be deleted
    - If the user sells less than all of their shares of a stock, then the stock entry will be updated in the database, as well as the table

# Pie Chart 

### Setup
-- The width and height of the overall canvas and the radius will be set by the parent component

### Calculations
-- Angles are based on the ratio of the book cost of the stock/total amount of money spent on investing OR total amount spent on the category/total amount spent
-- The endAngle of one wedge is the starting angle of the other wedge, drawn one by one on the canvas
--The colours of the wedges are randomly generated
--Upon any updates to the dom(such as adding/deleting/editing the table), the pie chart will redraw, with new colours

### Hover
--When you place your cursor over a certain edge, it will show the dollar amount invested in a stock/spent in that category
 --After 0.5s the dollar amount will disappear by repainting that wedge with the saved colour and angles
  --The hover detection is based on the mouse's position relative to the surface area of the wedges(by comparing the angle with respect to the center of the piechart and the absolute distance between the cursor and the center of the pie chart)
 --If the angle is within the start and end angles of a wedge and the absolute distance between the mouse and the center of the pie is less than the radius, than it will detect this as a hover

 # Views
-- If regular users log in to the website, they will be able to see 3 tabs on the navigation bar: "Spendings", "Investments", "Community", and "Resources". 
-- If financial advisors log in to the website, they will only be able to see the "Community" and "Manage" tabs on the navigation bar, as that is the purpose for them (to provide advice to regular users and to manage posts on the forum)
